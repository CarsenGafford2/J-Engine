## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in J-Engine, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Report privately:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) in this repository. This allows you to report vulnerabilities securely without exposing them publicly.
2. **Response time:** You can expect an acknowledgment maybe at some point.
3. **Resolution:** We will work to release a fix as soon as we can.
4. **Disclosure:** Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a patch has been released.

Your help in responsibly reporting security issues is greatly appreciated and helps keep J-Engine safe for everyone.
