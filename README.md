# J-Engine

J-Engine is a Open-Source 2D game engine built in Java using JavaFX, designed to simplify the creation of 2D games. Currently, the project is in its early stages and serves as the foundation for future development.

## Features (Planned)

- 2D rendering
- Scene and game object management
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse, Maybe Controller Support)
- Animation system / Sprite Sheets
- Collisions and physics
- Game loop and timing utilities
- Plugin Support
- Potentially visual scripting options
